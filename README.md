# Experiment 15: Recursion

## Aim

To study and implement recursion in C++.

## Theory

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is particularly useful for problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems. Each recursive function typically includes:

- **Base Case**: A condition that stops the recursion.
- **Recursive Case**: The part of the function that calls itself with modified arguments.

## Algorithms

1. **Addition of Integers**: A recursive function to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Reverse String**: A function that reverses a string using recursion.
3. **Reverse Number**: A function to reverse the digits of an integer.

## Files

- `addition_int.cpp`: Implements the addition of integers.
- `factorial.cpp`: Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- `integer_reverse.cpp`: Reverses the digits of an integer.
- `string_reverse.cpp`: Reverses a given string.

## Usage

Compile and run the C++ files using any C++ compiler to observe the recursive implementations.
